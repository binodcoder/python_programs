What I understood is there is import function in python
In import you need to call the function from different files
so while calling your function first you need to write
(from) that means where you calling it from?
and you need to write the files name like which files you want 
to call and then write import cause you are importing the function
of there and write the functions name which functions you want to call
and this is called user-defined function cause it is defined by the user
you yourself.
